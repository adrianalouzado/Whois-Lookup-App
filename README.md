How It Works
1. The application prompts the user to enter a domain name.
2. The whois_lookup function creates a socket connection to the IANA WHOIS server.
3. The domain name is sent to the WHOIS server, which returns the WHOIS information.
4. The response is displayed to the user.
5. The process repeats until the user types 'exit'.
